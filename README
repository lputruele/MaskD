This is the source code and binaries distribution of the Masking Distance Tool,

you need to set the environment variable 'MASKD' with:

export MASKD = <path to jar files>

HOW TO COMPILE:

ant compile jar

HOW TO RUN IT:

Usage: ./maskD <options> <nominal model path> <faulty model path>

Output: lim n->infinity of 1/(1+sumMaskedFaults[0..n]), where n is the number of steps and sumMaskedFaults[inf..sup] is the amount of faults masked from inf to sup

Options: 
 -d : create dot file 
 -t : print error trace 
 -s : start simulation 
 -l : treat deadlock as error state too

Some examples can be found
in the folder: tests/

More especifically, on tests/nominal/ are the nominal models, and on tests/faulty/ are them faulty counterparts.

For the case of phils, run with option -l, for example: ./maskD -l ../tests/nominal/phils/phils3.test ../tests/faulty/phils/phils3.test

To replicate all experimental results shown on paper "Measuring Masking Fault-Tolerance" (Castro, D’Argenio, Demasi, Putruele), run the mask-test script: ./mask-test

This is the first version of the tool, we expect to add further features and examples
soon.
